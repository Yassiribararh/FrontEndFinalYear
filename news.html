          <h2 >Our mediocre midfield are responsible for Liverpool failings:</h2>
          <h3>Liverpool have been able to scrape by for the most part with hard work, overachieving in the midfield at times,
            and by establishing full-backs as the basis for attacking in the final third.
            This worked well all last season and for a large chunk of this campaign as well.
            But the injury to Hendo has exposed a severe lack of midfield quality in this side and not much to speak of in reserve.
            Adam Lallana just isn’t good enough, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain hasn’t gotten it done,
            and Naby Keita has fallen far short of what has been required. Georginio Wijnaldum has been the most consistent, followed closely by Fabinho.
            But since Hendo was dropped from that midfield the results are ominous.

         <h2 >Liverpool vs Atletico: Jurgen Klopp cryptic on Jordan Henderson return:</h2>
         <h3>One of the best keepers in the world, the Brazilian international has been in fine form for the Reds over the past couple of months,
             keeping ten clean sheets in his last 13 Premier League matches.
             However, Klopp has confirmed that Alisson will miss tomorrow’s match against the Cherries due to a muscle injury at Anfield but didn’t say anything regarding it’s extent.
             Speaking to Liverpool’s official website, the 52-year-old said:
             “Unfortunately Ali is out. He had a little incident in training before the Chelsea game. We all thought it was nothing and it was clear he would not play anyway, the plan was he was on the bench.”

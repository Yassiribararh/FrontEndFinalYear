        <h2>(1892–1959):</h2>
        <h3>The club was founded in 1892 following a split from Everton F.C.
            and joined the Football League in 1893. The appointment of Tom Watson as manager
            resulted in the club's first successful period, in which they won two League
            Championships. Two League Championships were won in the 1920s and a further
            one was won in 1947. Following the club's fortunes declined and they were
            relegated to the Second Division in 1954.

        <h2>(1959–1985):</h2>
        <h3> Bill Shankly was appointed as manager in 1959 and guided the club back into the First Division.
             Shankly's arrival laid the foundations for the club's success in the 1970s
             and 80s domestically and in European competition, as the club won numerous
             League Championships and four European Cups.

        <h2>(1985–present): </h2>
        <h3>Following the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985, English clubs were banned from
            European competitions until 1991. The club was still successful domestically
            winning three League Championships during this period. The 1990s saw a lack
            of success for the club as they struggled to repeat their success in the
            Premier League era. The club reached former heights in 2005 when they won
            the UEFA Champions League (formerly known as the European Cup) for a fifth
            time.
